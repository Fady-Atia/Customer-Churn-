# Customer Churn ðŸš¶ Prediction - Imbalanced Classification Approach 
## The goal of the project is to analyze data and predict whether a customer will churn or not

# Project overview 
This project focuses on building a machine learning model for customer churn prediction. Churn refers to a customer ceasing to do business with a company. Accurately predicting churn allows businesses to identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

# Tackling Imbalanced Data for Accurate Customer Churn Prediction
This project goes beyond standard classification by addressing the common issue of imbalanced datasets in customer churn prediction. Imbalanced data occurs when one class (churned customers) is significantly underrepresented compared to the other (loyal customers). This can lead to models that are biased towards the majority class, resulting in poor churn prediction for the minority class (churned customers).

To overcome this challenge, I used SMOTE technique to balence the data

# Project Structure:
 * Importing necessary libraries
 * Reading Dataset
 * Undertanding the data & EDA
 * preprocessing 
 * SMOTE to handle imbalence data
 * Model Evalution
   

# Model Performance:
* Random Forest ->>accuracy = 94%
* Xgboost classifier ->> accuracy = 93%
* svm ->>accuracy = 88 %
* AdaBoost ->> accuracy = 86%
